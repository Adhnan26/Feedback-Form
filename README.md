📝 Feedback Form Project :

Overview :
This is my first JavaScript project, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through EMC (Electronics & Media Center). The Feedback Form allows users to submit their thoughts and suggestions in a simple and interactive way. It is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

🚀 Features :

👤 User-friendly Input Fields: Name, Email, and Message with a 200-character limit.

⌨️ Dynamic Character Counter: Tracks message length in real-time to enhance user experience.

✅ Form Validation: Ensures users enter valid email and required fields.

🎉 Submit Alert & Reset: Displays a success alert and clears the form after submission.

🎨 Attractive Design: Vibrant gradient background, rounded inputs, hover effects, and a modern form card.

📱 Responsive Layout: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes.


🛠 Technologies Used :

HTML5 – Structure of the form.

CSS3 – Styling, responsive design, and gradients.

JavaScript (JS) – Form validation, dynamic character counter, and submission handling.


🌟 Why This Project is Special :

💻 First JS Project: This was my introduction to JavaScript interactivity, giving me hands-on experience with event listeners and DOM manipulation.

🏫 Completed via EMC: Developed as part of EMC training, which helped me learn structured web development practices.

📁 Portfolio Ready: The project demonstrates frontend skills, attention to UI/UX, and responsiveness.


🔮 Future Improvements :

~ Integrate a backend to store feedback in a database.

~ Add 📧 email notifications to confirm submissions.

~ Include ⭐ rating stars or dropdown options for structured feedback.

~ Upgrade to modern UI designs like floating labels or glassmorphism.
